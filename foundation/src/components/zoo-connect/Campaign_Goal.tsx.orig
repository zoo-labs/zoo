            <p className='text-xl'>What we know</p>
            <p className='text-sm'>The International Union for Conservation of Nature has identified over 16,000 animal species currently under threat of extinction. These staggering numbers include 41% of amphibians, 38% of sharks and rays, 27% of mammals, and 13% of birds. Much of this threat comes from human activities, including deforestation, overexploitation, and climate change.</p>
            <p className='text-sm'>Despite these daunting figures, only 3% of donor dollars in the US go to environmental and animal welfare organizations combined. However, a hopeful 62% of Americans believe that the government is doing too little to protect animals and their habitats.</p>
            <p className='text-sm'>It seems there's a disconnect: if so many Americans care about animal welfare and conservation, why aren't more donor dollars going towards these causes? We're determined to bridge this gap. This is why we are launching Zoo Connect - an interactive platform that brings our zoo community closer to the animals they love and support.</p>

            <hr />
            <p className='text-xl'>Our Vision</p>
            <p className='text-sm'>We envision Zoo Connect to become the most comprehensive and accessible digital platform for our zoo community, enhancing our mission of wildlife conservation and education. On Zoo Connect, you will be able to discover detailed information about our resident animals, their natural habitats, conservation statuses, and more.</p>

            <p className='text-xl'>How it Works</p>
            <p className='text-sm'>Zoo Connect will be a user-friendly website designed for both desktop and mobile use, allowing our zoo community to explore and learn about our work.</p>
