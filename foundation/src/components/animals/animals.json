      "head": "The pygmy hippo is a rare, nocturnal herbivore found in West African rainforests. Weighing around 400-600 lbs and standing 2.5 ft tall, they're half the height and a quarter the weight of their cousin, the common hippo.<br /><br />With webbed toes and sleek bodies, they're agile swimmers and can close their nostrils to stay submerged. They secrete a shiny, slippery substance called 'blood sweat' to keep their skin moist and protect against sunburn, earning the nickname 'water horse.'",
      "subtitle": "The elusive pygmy hippo is so rare and secretive that it wasn't scientifically described until 1844.",
      "desc": "Pygmy hippos are mostly solitary creatures, a stark contrast to their highly social relatives, the common hippos. Despite their small size, pygmy hippos have large, tusk-like canine teeth that can grow up to 6 inches long, serving as a formidable weapon when threatened.<br /><br />Furthermore theg greatly contribute to the health of their rainforest ecosystem by dispersing seeds through their droppings, acting as efficient gardeners for their habitat."
