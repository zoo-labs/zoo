      "Journey to the Devil's Teeth ‚Äì the Island of the Great White Shark ‚Äì on this extraordinary conservation expedition into the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. These unique natural history trips focus on the geology, biology, and ecology of one of the world's most important marine sanctuaries, scheduled exclusively during 'Sharktober' when great whites return from their 4,000-mile Pacific migration.\n\nüìç **Meeting Point:** Fisherman's Wharf at 7:30 AM (between Castagnola's and Tarantino's restaurants, look for the EAT CRAB sign). Board the US Coast Guard inspected vessel AMIGO for an 8:00 AM departure, returning by 4:30 PM.\n\nüõ§Ô∏è **Expedition Route:** Departing San Francisco Bay, we navigate the Marin coastline to Drakes Bay and deeper waters, ultimately reaching 'Shark Alley' ‚Äì the zone with the highest predation probability on Earth, where great whites hunt elephant seals in their natural habitat.\n\nüêã **Wildlife Encounters:** The sanctuary hosts an incredible diversity of life including 36 marine mammal species, 18 cetacean species (featuring blue, gray, and humpback whales), 5 pinniped species (elephant seals, sea lions, harbor seals), and over 250,000 seabirds from 12 nesting species. While we often see sharks, this is a comprehensive marine ecosystem expedition.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This is a conservation-focused wildlife education expedition, not a commercial shark tour. We're one of the few operators permitted under NOAA's White Shark Stewardship Program. No attractants are used ‚Äì this is pure, ethical wildlife observation. Landing on the protected islands is prohibited by federal regulations.",
