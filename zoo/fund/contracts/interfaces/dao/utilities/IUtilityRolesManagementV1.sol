/**
 * @title IUtilityRolesManagementV1
 * @notice Unified interface for creating and managing organizational roles with Hats Protocol and Sablier streams
 * @dev This interface provides comprehensive functionality for managing "roles" - the combination
 * of Hats Protocol positions and their associated Sablier payment streams. It handles the complete
 * lifecycle of roles including creation, payment management, and stream administration.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Create complete organizational structures from scratch
 * - Add new roles to existing Hats trees
 * - Set up payment streams for all roles
 * - Support for both termed (elected) and untermed positions
 * - Integration with autonomous admin for automated management
 *
 * Workflow for new trees:
 * 1. Safe calls createAndDeclareTree via delegatecall
 * 2. Utility creates top hat and mints to Safe
 * 3. Utility creates admin hat with autonomous admin
 * 4. Utility creates all role hats with configurations
 * 5. Utility sets up payment streams for each role
 *
 * Workflow for adding roles:
 * 1. Safe with existing hat tree calls createRoleHats via delegatecall
 * 2. Utility creates new role hats under existing admin
 * 3. Utility sets up payment streams for new roles
 * 4. Utility creates eligibility modules if needed
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Initial DAO setup with complete role structure
 * - Creating new departments or teams within a DAO
 * - Adding new contributors to existing teams
 * - Setting up compensation structures
 * - Establishing governance hierarchies
