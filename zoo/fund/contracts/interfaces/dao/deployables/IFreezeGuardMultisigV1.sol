/**
 * @title IFreezeGuardMultisigV1
 * @notice Freeze guard implementation for standard multisig Safe child DAOs with timelock functionality
 * @dev This guard variant is designed for child DAOs that operate as standard multisig Safes
 * without Azorius governance. It attaches directly to the Safe as a transaction guard.
 * In addition to freeze checking, it implements a timelock mechanism where transactions must
 * be timelocked before execution, providing a window for freeze votes to occur.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Enforces timelock period before transaction execution
 * - Provides execution window after timelock expires
 * - Integrates with parent's freeze voting mechanism
 * - Prevents execution if DAO becomes frozen during timelock
 *
 * Transaction flow:
 * 1. Signers create and sign a transaction
 * 2. Transaction must be timelocked (registered) before execution
 * 3. After timelock period, transaction can execute within execution window
 * 4. Parent can freeze during timelock to prevent execution
 *
 * Security benefits:
 * - Gives parent DAO time to review and potentially freeze
 * - Prevents rushed or malicious transactions
 * - Maintains multisig autonomy while enabling parent oversight
