/**
 * @title IPaymasterV1
 * @notice ERC-4337 paymaster for sponsoring gasless transactions in the DAO Protocol
 * @dev This paymaster enables gasless voting and other operations by sponsoring transaction fees
 * for Light Account users. It integrates with function validators to ensure only authorized
 * operations are sponsored.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Sponsors gas fees for Light Account operations
 * - Per-function validation through external validator contracts
 * - Configurable validation rules for different target contracts and functions
 * - Owner-controlled validator management
 *
 * Workflow:
 * 1. Owner sets validators for specific contract functions
 * 2. Light Account users submit UserOperations through EntryPoint
 * 3. Paymaster validates the operation using the configured validator
 * 4. If valid, paymaster sponsors the gas fees
 *
 * Integration:
 * - Works with ERC-4337 EntryPoint and Light Accounts
 * - Validators implement IFunctionValidator for custom validation logic
 * - Commonly used for gasless voting in StrategyV1 contracts
