/**
 * @title IStrategyV1
 * @notice Core voting strategy contract for the Azorius governance system
 * @dev This contract manages the voting logic for proposals created through ModuleAzoriusV1.
 * It handles vote counting, quorum and basis calculations, and determines whether proposals
 * pass or fail. The strategy uses modular voting configurations that combine weight
 * calculation strategies with vote tracking, enabling support for various token standards
 * (ERC20, ERC721, etc.).
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Fixed voting period duration applied to all proposals
 * - Quorum threshold (minimum participation required)
 * - Basis threshold (minimum approval percentage required)
 * - Multiple voting configurations for different token types
 * - Multiple proposer adapters for access control
 * - Light Account support for gasless voting
 * - Freeze voter authorization for emergency governance
 *
 * Voting mechanics:
 * - Supports YES, NO, and ABSTAIN votes
 * - Quorum calculation: YES + ABSTAIN votes must meet threshold
 * - Basis calculation: YES votes must exceed required percentage of YES + NO votes
 * - Voting constraints are configuration-specific (e.g., ERC20 configs typically allow one vote per address,
 *   while ERC721 configs allow one vote per NFT, enabling multiple votes from the same address)
 *
 * Integration with Azorius:
 * - Azorius calls initializeProposal() when a proposal is created
 * - Azorius calls isPassed() to determine if a proposal can be executed
 * - Each proposal uses the strategy that was active when it was created
