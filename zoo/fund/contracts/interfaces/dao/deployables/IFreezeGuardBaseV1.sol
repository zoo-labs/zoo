/**
 * @title IFreezeGuardBaseV1
 * @notice Base interface for freeze guards that prevent transaction execution when a DAO is frozen
 * @dev Freeze guards are Zodiac Guards attached to a child DAO that check freeze status before
 * allowing any transaction execution. This is a critical component of the parent-child DAO
 * security model, preventing a potentially compromised child from executing transactions while
 * the parent DAO investigates or intervenes.
 *
 * Integration with Safe:
 * - Attached as a transaction guard on the child DAO
 * - Called before and after every transaction execution
 * - Blocks all transactions when the associated FreezeVoting contract reports frozen status
 *
 * Parent-child relationship:
 * - Enables parent DAOs to emergency-freeze child DAOs
 * - Works in conjunction with FreezeVoting contracts
 * - Allows parent intervention without giving permanent control
