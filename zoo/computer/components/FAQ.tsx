      question: "What's included with DGX Spark?",
      answer: "DGX Spark includes a dedicated DGX instance with 100 hours of compute time, 2TB of NVMe storage, a pre-configured AI stack (PyTorch, TensorFlow, CUDA toolkit), and access to community support. Setup is instantâ€”you can start training models within minutes of purchase."
    },
    {
      question: "How does pricing work?",
      answer: "DGX Spark is a one-time $4,000 payment that includes 100 hours of compute. For on-demand usage beyond that, check out Hanzo Cloud for pay-as-you-go pricing. Enterprise customers can contact sales for custom SuperPOD deployments and volume pricing."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I scale beyond DGX Spark?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Start with DGX Spark and seamlessly scale to Hanzo Cloud for on-demand H100/H200 access, or upgrade to dedicated SuperPODs for enterprise workloads. Your data and configurations can migrate easily across our infrastructure."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of support do I get?",
      answer: "DGX Spark includes community support via our Discord and documentation. Cloud Compute users get email support with 24-hour response times. Enterprise customers receive 24/7 dedicated support with custom SLAs and a dedicated account manager."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure is my data?",
      answer: "All data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3). Each instance is isolated with dedicated VPC networking. We're SOC 2 Type II certified and GDPR compliant. Enterprise customers can add HIPAA compliance and private networking."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after 100 hours?",
      answer: "After your included 100 hours, you can top up compute time at competitive rates, upgrade to Hanzo Cloud for flexible pay-as-you-go access, or maintain your instance for data storage at a low monthly rate while you plan your next project."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use my own software?",
      answer: "Yes! While we provide a pre-configured AI stack, you have full root access to install any frameworks, libraries, or custom software. Our instances support Docker, Kubernetes, and all major AI/ML frameworks."
    },
    {
      question: "What's your refund policy?",
      answer: "We offer a 7-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied with your DGX Spark instance. For used compute hours, we'll prorate the refund. Enterprise contracts have custom terms negotiated with your sales representative."
