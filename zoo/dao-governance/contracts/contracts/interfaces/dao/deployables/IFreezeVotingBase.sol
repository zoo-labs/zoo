/**
 * @title IFreezeVotingBase
 * @notice Base interface for freeze voting contracts that enable parent DAOs to freeze child DAOs
 * @dev Freeze voting is a critical emergency mechanism in parent-child DAO relationships.
 * It allows token holders of a parent DAO to vote to freeze a child DAO's operations,
 * preventing the child from executing any transactions while frozen.
 *
 * Key mechanics:
 * - Freeze proposals are separate from regular governance proposals
 * - Votes accumulate until the threshold is reached
 * - Once threshold is met, the child DAO is immediately frozen
 * - Freezes are permanent until explicitly unfrozen
 * - Concrete implementations define their own unfreeze mechanism
 *
 * Security features:
 * - Time-limited freeze proposals prevent stale votes
 * - Permanent freezes require explicit unfreeze action
 * - Configurable threshold allows DAOs to set appropriate requirements
 * - Implementations may add ownership or voting-based control
 *
 * This base interface defines the common freeze voting functionality shared by
 * different implementations (Azorius-based and Multisig-based parent DAOs).
