/**
 * @title IAutonomousAdminV1
 * @notice Autonomous administration for Hats Protocol roles with term transitions
 * @dev This contract automates the transition between terms for Hats that use
 * the HatsElectionsEligibility module. It acts as an admin that can be called
 * by anyone to trigger term transitions, removing the need for manual intervention.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Permissionless term transitions
 * - Automatic hat burning for ineligible wearers
 * - Automatic hat minting to new nominees
 * - Works with HatsElectionsEligibility module
 *
 * Workflow:
 * 1. Anyone calls triggerStartNextTerm when a term expires
 * 2. Contract calls startNextTerm on the elections module
 * 3. Checks current wearer's eligibility and burns if needed
 * 4. Mints hat to the nominated wearer if different
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Automated role transitions for elected positions
 * - Removing dependency on specific admins
 * - Ensuring timely term transitions
 * - DAOralized role management
