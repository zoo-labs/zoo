/**
 * @title IFreezeVotingAzoriusV1
 * @notice Freeze voting implementation for Azorius-based parent DAOs
 * @dev This contract enables token holders of an Azorius-based parent DAO to vote
 * to freeze a child DAO. It leverages the parent's existing voting adapters and
 * token infrastructure for freeze voting.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Uses parent DAO's strategy and voting configurations for voting weight
 * - Automatic new freeze proposal creation if previous one expired
 * - Supports multiple voting adapters in a single vote
 * - Light Account support for gasless freeze voting
 *
 * Freeze voting process:
 * 1. If no active proposal exists, first voter creates one automatically
 * 2. Voters use parent's voting adapters to cast weighted votes
 * 3. When threshold is reached, child DAO is immediately frozen
 * 4. Parent DAO (owner) can unfreeze at any time
 *
 * Integration:
 * - References parent's Azorius module for strategy information
 * - Voting weight calculated through parent's voting configurations
 * - Owned by the parent DAO for administrative control
