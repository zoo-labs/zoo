 * @title IVoteTrackerV1
 * @notice Interface for contracts that track voting participation
 * @dev This interface enables modular vote tracking separate from weight calculation.
 * Implementations can track votes differently based on token type:
 * - ERC20: Simple address-based tracking (one vote per address)
 * - ERC721: Token ID-based tracking (prevent reuse of specific NFTs)
 *
 * The separation of vote tracking from weight calculation allows:
 * - Different tracking strategies for different token types
 * - Reuse of tracking logic across voting contexts
 * - Clear separation of concerns
 *
 * Vote trackers are responsible for:
 * - Recording that a vote has occurred
 * - Preventing double voting
 * - Validating vote data format
 * - NOT calculating weights or validating token ownership
