/**
 * @title IModuleAzoriusV1
 * @notice Central governance module for DAOs using the Azorius Protocol
 * @dev This module serves as the core governance system that manages proposals and executes
 * transactions through a Gnosis Safe. It acts as a Zodiac module, enabling modular
 * governance with support for various voting strategies and token standards.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Proposal submission with customizable proposer adapters
 * - Flexible voting through a delegated strategy contract
 * - Timelock mechanism for security
 * - Execution period constraints
 * - Safe integration for transaction execution
 *
 * The module delegates voting logic to a Strategy contract, allowing DAOs to
 * customize their voting mechanisms without modifying the core governance module.
 *
 * Integration requirements:
 * - Must be enabled as a module on the target Safe
 * - Requires a valid Strategy contract for voting
 * - Supports various proposer adapters for access control
