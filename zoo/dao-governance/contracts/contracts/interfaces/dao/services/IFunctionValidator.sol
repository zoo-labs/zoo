/**
 * @title IFunctionValidator
 * @notice Service interface for validating function calls in the context of ERC-4337 operations
 * @dev This interface defines a standard for validators that determine whether a paymaster
 * should sponsor a specific operation. Validators implement custom logic to check if
 * a Light Account owner is authorized to perform a specific function call.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Stateless validation of operations
 * - Function-specific authorization logic
 * - Integration with paymasters for gas sponsorship decisions
 * - Support for complex validation rules
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Paymasters (like PaymasterV1) call validators to check operations
 * - Each target contract/function pair can have its own validator
 * - Validators can check voting power, roles, balances, or any other criteria
 *
 * Example implementations:
 * - StrategyV1ValidatorV1: Validates voting operations in governance strategies
 * - Custom validators for specific business logic
 *
 * Security:
 * - Validators should be carefully audited as they control gas sponsorship
 * - Must handle edge cases and prevent exploitation
 * - Should validate all relevant parameters
