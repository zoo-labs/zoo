/**
 * @title IModuleFractalV1
 * @notice Execution module enabling parent-child DAO relationships
 * @dev This module is a critical component of hierarchical DAO structures, allowing
 * a parent DAO to execute transactions directly on a child DAO's Safe. It acts as
 * a Zodiac module that bypasses the child's normal governance processes, enabling
 * emergency interventions and administrative control.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Direct transaction execution by the parent DAO (owner)
 * - No voting or proposal mechanisms required on the child DAO
 * - Works in conjunction with freeze mechanisms for security
 * - Enables hierarchical DAO governance structures
 *
 * Parent-Child DAO Architecture:
 * - Installed on the child DAO's Safe as a module
 * - Owned by the parent DAO
 * - Often paired with FreezeGuard/FreezeVoting for complete control
 * - Allows parent to intervene when child DAO is frozen
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Emergency interventions when child DAO is compromised
 * - Administrative actions from parent to child
 * - Executing corrective measures after freezing a child DAO
 * - Managing sub-DAOs in a hierarchical structure
 *
 * Integration requirements:
 * - Must be enabled as a module on the child DAO's Safe
 * - Owner must be the parent DAO's Safe address
 * - Typically deployed alongside freeze mechanisms for full control
