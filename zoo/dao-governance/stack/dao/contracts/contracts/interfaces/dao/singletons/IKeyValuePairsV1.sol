/**
 * @title IKeyValuePairsV1
 * @notice Singleton contract for emitting on-chain key-value metadata
 * @dev This contract provides a simple, gas-efficient way to store metadata on-chain
 * through events. It's deployed once per chain and can be used by any address to
 * emit key-value pairs that can be indexed and queried off-chain.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Stateless - no storage, only events
 * - Permissionless - any address can emit metadata
 * - Gas efficient - uses events instead of storage
 * - Flexible - supports any string key-value pairs
 * - Indexable - events can be efficiently queried
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - DAO metadata (name, description, logo, links)
 * - Configuration parameters readable by frontends
 * - Any other metadata that should be publicly accessible
 *
 * Example usage:
 * - DAOs emit their metadata during setup
 * - DAOs can update their metadata at any time
