 * @title IVotingWeightV1
 * @notice Interface for contracts that calculate voting weight
 * @dev This interface enables modular voting weight calculation separate from vote tracking.
 * Implementations can use various methods to determine voting weight (token holdings,
 * whitelists, reputation systems, etc.).
 *
 * The separation of weight calculation from vote tracking allows:
 * - Reuse of weight calculations across different voting contexts
 * - Clean testing of weight calculation logic
 * - Easy addition of new voting weight strategies
 *
 * Voting weight contracts are responsible for:
 * - Storing configuration for weight calculation
 * - Calculating voting weight at specific timestamps
 * - Processing and validating vote data
 * - Returning processed data for vote tracking
