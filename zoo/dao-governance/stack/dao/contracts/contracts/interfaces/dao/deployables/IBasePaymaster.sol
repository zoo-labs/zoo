 * @dev Extends the standard paymaster with deposit and staking management.
 * This interface defines functions that are common to paymaster implementations
 * but not part of the core IPaymaster interface from the account-abstraction package.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Deposit management for gas fee sponsorship
 * - Staking functionality for EntryPoint requirements
 * - Withdrawal mechanisms for both deposits and stakes
 *
 * Security model:
 * - Only the paymaster owner can withdraw funds or manage stakes
 * - The EntryPoint validates all operations before execution
 * - Deposits are held by the EntryPoint, not the paymaster
