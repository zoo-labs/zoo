# Lux Exchange (LX) - HyperLiquid Feature Parity Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation plan and code to achieve feature parity between Lux Exchange (LX) and HyperLiquid DEX. The implementation covers both the decentralized exchange (X-Chain DEX) and centralized exchange (LX Pro) components.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Comprehensive feature parity implementation plan
- [x] Smart contract architecture for order book (OrderBook.sol)
- [x] Perpetual futures contract implementation (PerpetualMarket.sol)
- [x] High-performance matching engine in Go (matching_engine.go)
- [x] Documentation and technical specifications

### üöß In Progress
- [ ] Frontend interface for trading
- [ ] WebSocket implementation for real-time data
- [ ] Oracle integration for price feeds
- [ ] Liquidation engine optimization
- [ ] Cross-margin account system

### ‚ùå Not Started
- [ ] Mobile applications (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Advanced order types (TWAP, Iceberg)
- [ ] Copy trading functionality
- [ ] Market maker incentive program
- [ ] Security audits

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Core Trading Features
- **Spot Trading**: Token-to-token swaps with limit and market orders
- **Perpetual Futures**: Up to 50x leverage with funding rates
- **Order Types**: Market, Limit, Stop-Loss, Take-Profit, Trailing Stop
- **Cross-Margin**: Portfolio-based margin calculation

### 2. Performance Requirements
- **Throughput**: 100,000+ orders per second
- **Latency**: <10ms order placement, <1ms matching
- **Settlement**: Near-instant for spot, epoch-based for derivatives

### 3. Risk Management
- **Liquidation Engine**: Automatic position liquidation
- **Insurance Fund**: Protection against bankruptcy
- **ADL (Auto-Deleveraging)**: Cascade liquidation prevention
- **Circuit Breakers**: Extreme volatility protection

## Technical Architecture

### X-Chain (DEX)
- **Consensus**: Multi-consensus with X-Chain for exchange operations
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based order book and perpetuals
- **Settlement**: On-chain settlement with cross-chain bridges
- **Oracle**: Chainlink and Pyth Network price feeds

### LX Pro (CEX)

## API Documentation

### REST Endpoints
```
POST   /api/v1/orders       - Place order
GET    /api/v1/orders       - Get open orders
DELETE /api/v1/orders/:id   - Cancel order
GET    /api/v1/positions    - Get positions
GET    /api/v1/account      - Account information
GET    /api/v1/markets      - Market data
```

### WebSocket Streams
```javascript
// Subscribe to order book
ws.send({ op: "subscribe", channel: "orderbook", market: "BTC-USD" })

// Subscribe to trades
ws.send({ op: "subscribe", channel: "trades", market: "ETH-USD" })

// Subscribe to account updates
ws.send({ op: "subscribe", channel: "account" })
```

## Testing
