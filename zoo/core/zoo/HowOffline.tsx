      <p className="mb-10">
        An offline Ask will allow buyers to place a Bid without sending funds to
        the smart contract. The buyer will need to send you the funds directly
        as an {"over the counter"} deal. Example, they can send you a bank wire
        transfer.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        After you have verified receipt of the funds you can accept the bid.
        Accepting the offline bid will transfer ownership of the NFT to the
        buyer.
